                <p> Journey's Inception...<br>
                    My self Harsh Patel, born and raised in village named Vatadra which is located in the central part
                    of Gujarat in India. Later, at the age of 6, I was admitted to the school which was about 15kms away
                    from my village. My school name was Supath E.M.H.S located near the Gulf of Cambay. I studied their
                    for 14 years, from Playgroup to 12th grade. I use stay in top 5 rankings every year of my schooling.
                </p>

                <p>Schooling Period...<br>
                    There were ample of Co-Curricular activites including Sports, Inter-school Tournaments and many more
                    held in my school. I was very fond of it, so I use to participate in each and every activaties,
                    every year. During first 8 to 9 years I didn't recieved anything special in my achievements. But, as
                    a grew up and started understanding the things I started participating in more activities and here
                    the game begins... I was in 10th grade and I recieved the Hall of Fame For which I was working since
                    my childhood. In that year we had a Science Fair, and I was leading my group, we decided to built a
                    Robotic Remote Control Car. Also, there was a Grand Sports Tournament so, I participated in that
                    too. And lastly the day I was waiting for that came it was Annual Award Function Day. Supraisingly,
                    my father was called as the Chief Guest of the event. I was not ready to belive that he is here and
                    my work was done.
                </p>

                <p>Achievements...<br>
                    On that day I was holding the title of: "student of the year", "Sports Championship", "Best Project
                    of the Science Fair", "Best Student Teachers". And during my 14 years of schooling I recieved about
                    89 Certificates. Hence, this were the achievements I attained and I was really very happy to see my
                    father on stage and making them proud to be my parent.
                </p>

                <p>Goals...<br>
                    Afterall, before entering to the important years of my schooling i.e 11th and 12th grade, I decided
                    to pursue my further studies in Canada after completing my 12th Grade. And, I made it
                    scuccessfully.... I completed my 12th grade with 81%, later, I started preparing of IELTS to move 1
                    step ahead towards my goals. And again I cracked it. And finally I am here to complete my further
                    studies..
                </p>

                <p>To summarize "Experiencing a scuccessfull Life" That I made it happen, I succed in each and every
                    step of reaching my goals. Although many barriers came but I tackled and this experience defines me
                    that also in future, I am not going to stop untill and unless I will achieve all my goals and change
                    the status of "Experiencing a scuccessfull life" to "Experienced a scuccessfull life".
